a. Generate $T = 100$ observations from the following time series processes:

i) White Noise

$y_t = \epsilon_t$

ii) Moving Average

$y_t = 1.2 + \epsilon_t + 0.6\epsilon_{t-1}$

iii) Autoregressive Process AR(1)

$y_t = 0.2 + 0.9y_t 1 + \epsilon_t$

iv) Autoregressive Process AR(2)

where $\epsilon_t$ is iid and $N(0, 0.5)$ for all processes



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
